        <p>Choosing Monica Browne Weddings to meet my needs during one of the most important events in my life was a decision that hosts no regrets. True professionalism, at its best! While planning a wedding can be very stressful and hectic, my experience with Monica Browne Weddings was definitely one that was fun and exciting! All tasks were completed in a very organized manner and with so many things to accomplish, such organization was very important.</p>
        <p>Monica Browne Weddings also referred me to many vendors that were equally very professional. As a result, my wedding day was truly all that I had dreamed it to be and more! It was at last the vivid reality of all of the planning and decision making done in the prior months. I am so thankful for the memories I now have to cherish for a lifetime. Monica Browne Weddings........I can't thank you enough!</p>

        <p>Monica did a fantastic job of providing us with many options whether it was for caterers, florists, videographers, photographers, and venues. She also made sure that my husband and I had a lot of agency in the wedding planning process, while working to keep us as on schedule and close to budget as possible.</p>
        <p>On my big day, she and her staff made me feel incredibly special and relaxed as they coordinated wedding day details. I thoroughly enjoyed my actual wedding day!</p>
        <p>In addition, Monica demonstrated incredible versatility. She was not only able to help us plan a fantastic wedding day and reception, she also helped throw a very successful after party on the evening of the wedding.</p>
        <p>I have wonderful memories of my wedding day thanks to the investment and hard work of Monica and her staff!</p>

        <p>My Wedding Planner, Monica Browne, did such a terrific job on my wedding day.. in the snow!  We were married in the middle of a snowstorm and I could not believe how beautiful the ceremony was and how put together and gorgeous my reception was.  Every decoration, every table and My Cake..it arrived without incident.</p> 
        <p>My Wedding Day was put together so beautifully.  We finally had to curtail the reception in the end to ensure everyone got home safely, but everyone had such a fantastic time you would not have noticed.  It was the most beautiful wedding I had ever seen!   I could not have pulled off such a Beautiful Wedding Day without her expertise. My pictures tell it all!  Thank you Monica.  You are the best!</p>
        <p>If you need a Wedding Planner,  call Monica Browne for the wedding of your dreams. .   :-)</p>

        <p>I am so thankful that I used Uniquely Designed Affairs, now Monica Browne Weddings for my rooftop wedding in the summer of 2010. It has been 5 years and I still have family and friends tell me how beautiful my wedding day was. I could not have been more pleased at their work. They listened to all my wants and carried them out exactly how I asked them to. They were nice, understanding and very easy to work with. They kept me on track and made the experience enjoyable. I am very particular and I like to be involved in everything however, I was able to let go and have them handle everything. I was not disappointed at all and my day turned out perfect. I could go on and on. I would recommend them over and over again.</p>

        <p>Monica Browne organized  and planned my 50th birthday party at the Gaylord Hotel.  I wanted something unique and she came up with a wonderful concept that gave me a night to remember!  The decorations and the food was awesome!  Her attention to detail allowed me to carry out my theme.  I would highly recommend her for your next special occasion.</p>

        <p>I have had the pleasure of working with Monica for several years photographing weddings she has coordinated. Her events have always been timely and very detailed. She is very vendor friendly but will hold you to the highest standards which are her expectations. The orchestration of these events are very precise eliminating room for errors by the vendors. I appreciate working with such a consummate professional. I look forward to working events with Monica Browne in the future.</p>
